                <p>My group and I chose to make a website in order to streamline the process when fostering a pet. There is no website or resource that does this right now which we found to be a huge problem because the life of a pet would be at stake. </p>

                        <h3>Identify the Problem</h3>
                        <p>People that want to find a foster home for a pet don’t have the correct resources to do so. Fostering a pet is a great alternative if someone is unsure of whether they will have the long-term time commitment to adopt a pet but still want to help. There is an existing site (Petfinder) which helps people find adoptable pets in their area. However, there is no place to go to find pets who need fosters — these pets could be ones who are old, sick, less visually pleasing, or will take a long time to get adopted for other various reasons.</p>
                        <p>
                            My team and I wanted to create a website similar to (or even an extension of) Petfinder which would allow people to search for pets who need fosters. This would work from two ends; the shelters would post their pets who need fosters, and then the foster pet parents/rescues can search for animals to pull from the shelter for foster. This system would help people know exactly what to do if they are looking for an animal to foster, or have an animal that needs a foster.
                        </p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p> Much of the primary research was information supplied by my teammate, Alina, from past experiences being a foster parent. Animals who are not deemed “quickly adoptable” are given only a short period of time at the shelter before they are euthanized. To help give animals a longer amount of time to be adopted, people foster the animals.
                        </p>

                        <h2>
                            “Because of the flawed system, I received an email two hours before my cat’s euthanasia time and had to run to the shelter to save her. If there was a better, more efficient system, I could have gotten to her sooner.”
                        </h2>
                        <h4>
                            -Alina, concerned foster parent</h4>

                        <p>
                            Rescue organizations are "no kill", and they receive animals to foster by either pulling the animal from a shelter, or receiving them directly from a surrendering owner. Alina has experienced firsthand how difficult it is to find a pet in need in a timely manner, given the fact that the current “advertising” for pets in need of foster are emails sent to each organization individually.</p>

                    <div class="1-column-image subsection">
                        <h3>Survey</h3>
                        <p> As part of our research process, we sent out a survey to the Davis Pet and Supplies Facebook group. We had a great turn out with 49 responses. Of those responses, we were able to extract the most pressing needs from our audience to include in our website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The results of the survey showed us that there is a disconnect between people wanting to foster and actually fostering. 93% of people want to foster but only 43% actually do. This encouraged us to figure out what exactly is stopping people from actually fostering.</p>

                        <p>
                            There were three main concerns our audience had about fostering: money for care, time commitment, and housing situation.
                            People expressed financial
                            concerns about fostering, but are unaware that most organizations will pay for all the expenses.
                            Another concern was the
                            unknown time commitment —
                            because you have to foster
                            until the animal gets adopted, which could be a few weeks to a few months.
                            Lastly, people in our audience had
                            varied living situations. Most of them expressed concerns about too small of a place, the landlord not allowing pets, or roommates being allergic.</p>

                    <div class="1-column-image subsection">
                        <h3>Ideation</h3>
                        <p> We came up with three initial concepts to prototype. The first being a standard "filter" style. A clean grid of the animals that match your filter requests. If you say you want to foster a senior dog in Davis who gets along with other dogs, those are the dogs that show up in the grid. There would also be red, yellow, or green circles below each image depending on urgency of foster. </p>
                        <p>Our second idea was a "tinder for pets" style. The pets in your area show up one by one, and you can either swipe left or right depending on if you want to foster them or not. When you click on the profile you can see more photos and a description of the animal. </p>
                        <p>Our third idea was an "urgency line" style. The animals show up in order of urgency. The closer the animals are to the line, the less time they have before their euthanasia date. The animals who have passed the line are already euthanized, and their photos are gray-scale.
                        </p>

                        <p> Peer feedback from the mock-ups above determined that the urgency line concept was the most impactful, however it needed to be more eye-catching. There was also feedback that the images of the passed animals were too depressing, and needed to be downplayed but still there since it displayed a really strong message.

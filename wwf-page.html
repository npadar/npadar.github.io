            <p id="title"> Wireframes </p>
            <p id="description"> After extensively researching exisitng non-profits to identify key components included on their websites, I began to brainstorm ideas for my three-page non-profit project. To build this non-profit website, I first started out with making wireframes using the program wireframe.cc This helped me organize the basic layout and placement of content for each page. I estimated the placement and dimensions of what I wanted the content to look like. </p>

        <section id="mockups">
            <p id="title"> Mockups </p>

            <p id="description"> I then developed three different mockups for the homepage using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. This gave me a rough idea on how the website would turn out and what elements I would want to include in my final project. </p>

        <section id="final">
            <p id="title"> Final </p>
            <p id="description"> I ended up going with the general design of my second mockup, transferring the overall look of the design into the <a href="Web/WWF/Padar-Nicki-assignment-non-profit/about-page.html" class="links"> About Us </a> and <a href="Web/WWF/Padar-Nicki-assignment-non-profit/work-page.html" class="links"> Work </a> webpage. </p>

                        <h3>Purchase Landing Page</h3>
                        <p>This page was designed to test whether or not having a landing page that went directly to the checkout page would get more conversion.</p>
                        <p>The current flow of the website is: the user clicks on a retargeting ad, which leads them to a "School" landing page, which then takes them to a Nanodegree Program overview page, which then takes the user to the checkout page. </p>
                        <p>With this page that I designed, it could cut down the flow one step by taking the user from the ad to this page and then directly to the checkout page since the user has already visited the Nanodegree Program overview page. This page is still in testing.</p>

                        <h3>Lead Generation Landing Page</h3>
                        <p> As part of Udacity's growth initiative, the marketing design team created lead generation pages in order to get new user emails. The hypothesis for these pages is that a clean, simple layout with the value props shown above the fold will get more leads. These designs are still in testing.

                        <p> I created this short, animated video ad as part of the Black Friday Campaign. I wanted the animation to emphasize our theme "Black Friday, Bright Future" so I created a "neon light" type of effect. </p>

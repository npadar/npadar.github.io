        <h4>UX/UI</h4>
        <p>This project was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript as part of a UX/UI course. I'm extremely passionate about saving the environment and animals so I decided to center my project around the concept of conservation. My goal was to create an interactive map using the Javascript library, Mapbox, of endangered species in order to raise awareness of this rapidly increasing problem.</p>
        <p> The basic concept I wanted to implement in this project was when the user hovers over certain places on the map, an image and description of the animal would appear along with a section on how to help. There are many ways to help these animals such as practicing sustainable shopping, the government implementing a carbon tax, and overall just increasing awareness of these problems. For example, many animals in the Sumatran rainforest in Southeast Asia are greatly affected by palm oil plantations. Consumers can help by simply reading the label on a product and not buying anything that contains unsustainable palm oil.</p>

            <img src="images/projects/vanishing/needfinding4.jpg" class="img-responsive img">

            <p>For the needfinding step, I had my users interact with the <a href="https://www.wwf.org" target="_blank">World Wildlife Fund</a> website. I found out that for my website, it needs to have some sort of indication that elements are able to be clicked. Users also felt that there was a lot of information and was overwhelmed by all the text. Most importantly, it must be engaging enough to influence the user to take action.</p>

            <img src="images/projects/vanishing/storyboard3.PNG">
            <p class="answer">Through this activity, I learned about the things that my project needs in order to fulfill the user’s needs. My interactive map will contain a bunch of dots that when clicked on will reveal the endangered species in that region and the issues in the region that are causing the endangerment. In order to let the user fully understand what the goal of my project is, I need to make sure that there is an order in which they view the project. For example, the user needs to go on the map, click on a dot, read the information on the popup and at the final step read the “how to help” section. Getting the user to take action is the main goal of this project. When discussing my storyboards with my partner, the sequence and end goal wasn’t as clear as it should have been. Another thing that must be specified is some sort of background information about the causes of each problem in the region. My partner wanted to know how their actions would help the cause directly. After doing this activity, the user goal is much more clear and I am now focused on implementing them in order for the user to get the best user experience.</p>

        <div id="prototype">
            <h4>Prototype</h4>
            <div class="proto1">
                <img src="images/projects/vanishing/prototype1.PNG">
                <img src="images/projects/vanishing/prototype2.PNG">
                <p>In the first prototype, I realized a few things that the user needed in order to receive the best user experience. One thing that I definitely needed to add was a legend in order for the user to understand why the dots are different sizes. The legend will contain information on the species conservation status. Another thing that needed clarification was the navigation labeling. I first used "Causes" and "Help" as two of the navigation tabs. However, when testing the prototype with my partner, they said that those two tabs were misleading. They thought that "Causes" meant something about the causes the species stood for, which doesn't really make sense and they thought that "Help" referred to needing help using the site.</p>

                <img src="images/projects/vanishing/prototype4.PNG">
                <img src="images/projects/vanishing/prototype5.PNG">
                <p>In my second prototype, I added a legend which definitely made things a lot clearer to the user. I decided to change the two confusing navigation names to "Causes to the Endangerment" and "How to Help". This made it easier for the user to understand what each page would represent. At the bottom of each popup, there would be arrows that would lead users to the next page. My partner suggested putting the name of the next tab with the arrow so that the user will have a clear understanding that clicking on the arrow would lead them to the next tab. We decided that both the tab navigation at the top and the bottom arrow navigation were necessary in order to ensure the best user experience. The top navigation bar is so that the user can jump around the different pages in case they want to reread a page. The bottom navigation gives the user a sense of sequence of which order to read the pages in. Both of these navigation options combined best helped the user navigate around the site.</p>

            <h4>User Testing</h4>
            <img src="images/projects/vanishing/test1.JPG">
            <img src="images/projects/vanishing/test2.JPG">
            <img src="images/projects/vanishing/test3.JPG">
            <p>Both of my testers understood the overall purpose of my project which was to create a conversation about endangered animals. Both users said that the continuous world was really confusing since the interactive dots only worked on the main map, when they panned to a different map, it would seem like the popups didn't work. However, it was just that the popup was popping up on the main map. They were also both unable to figure out how to turn on and off layers. They also commented on the popup design and said that they wished the box was bigger. Also, Joseph commented that he wished there was a hover and tooltip over the dot so the user knows that element is interactive. He also discovered the map rotate function which I did not know to access beforehand since I have been using my laptop to make my project and you need a mouse in order to access it. Iris was my other tester and wished that she could open multiple popups at the same time. Also, the "X" exit button and the font-size on each popup were too small.</p>

            <p>For my final project I will try to implement all these changes. I think that the most pressing change is definitely the continuous world. That was super confusing to the audience and needs to be fixed immediately. I am also going to add "hints" at the bottom of the map so the user knows that the layers are able to hidden and that they can rotate the map.</p>

            <p>This activity was extremely useful because it helped me understand what my project was lacking. Getting immediate feedback was really nice because I was able to ask detailed questions and ask for suggestions. It was also very helpful to just watch the testers use my project. I was able to see exactly which parts of my project needed improving upon since normally I would not have the user right in front of me. This will help me create the best experience for the user.</p>

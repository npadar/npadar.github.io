                <h1> Stranger Things</h1>
                <p>For part of my intro to motion typography and After Effects class, I recreated the Stranger Things TV show title sequence. I really enjoyed this opening because it was creepy and fitting to the TV show's theme. I animated the last 20 seconds of the sequence because I felt that part was the most interesting to make. </p>

                <h3>Final Video</h3>
                <p> I first had to animate each individual letter manually. The letters throughout the title sequence are constantly moving into their final position. At the same time, the camera is panning outward, constantly zooming further and further away from the letters. In order to do this, I made keyframes every three seconds to scale the letters down slightly. At the same time, I also animated the letters by position based on where they were coming from and where they would end up. I then added in the final rectangles at the end where they expand outward, signaling the end of the sequence. After I finished animating the individual letters, I added on the effects.
                    <!--I used a tutorial I found online to help me with the “glowing” effect on the letters.-->


                </p>
                <p>
                    I selected all my animated letters and precomposed them into a new composition. This made it much easier to add the effects on all the letters at once. I added the fractal noise effect and then blended that into the letter layer. This gave the letters an inconsistent tint to them so that some parts of the letter would glow more than other parts. I then added in the glow effect and red color. At the end, I continued to zoom out and slowly faded the letters away. Finally, I added in the audio clip which brought the whole piece together.</p>
